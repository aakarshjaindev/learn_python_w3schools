# Python Revision

This project is designed to help users revise their Python knowledge through a series of flashcard-style questions and answers. The content is divided into three main sections: Basics, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each section contains questions that test your understanding of Python syntax and concepts, along with corresponding answers for self-assessment.

## Structure

- **Basics**: Fundamental concepts and syntax of Python.
  - `questions.md`: Contains questions related to basic Python topics.
  - `answers.md`: Provides answers to the questions in the basics section.

- **Intermediate**: Focuses on more complex topics such as data structures, functions, and modules.
  - `questions.md`: Contains questions related to intermediate Python topics.
  - `answers.md`: Provides answers to the questions in the intermediate section.

- **Advanced**: Covers advanced topics including decorators, generators, and context managers.
  - `questions.md`: Contains questions related to advanced Python concepts.
  - `answers.md`: Provides answers to the questions in the advanced section.

## How to Use
